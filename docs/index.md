# Docs

This folder contains the project documentation.

## Start here

- Setup: `setup.md`
- Usage: `usage.md`
- Architecture: `architecture.md`
- FAQ: `faq.md`

## How to keep docs healthy

- Prefer short sections and concrete examples.
- Keep commands copy/paste-ready.
- When behavior changes, update `usage.md` and add a note to `faq.md` if needed.
