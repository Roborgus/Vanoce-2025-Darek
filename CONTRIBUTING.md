# Contributing

Thanks for helping!

## Ground rules

- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Prefer small PRs over big rewrites.
- If you change behavior, update docs (`docs/usage.md`) and add/adjust tests (if/when tests exist).

## Development workflow

1. Create a branch.
2. Make changes.
3. Open a PR with:
   - what changed
   - why it changed
   - how to test

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

- TODO: add the preferred channel (GitHub Issues, email, etc.)
